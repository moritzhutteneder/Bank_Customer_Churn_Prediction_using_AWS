# Bank Customer Churn Prediction

#### This project aims to predict customer churn for a bank using machine learning models on AWS.

**Problem Description:**
The main objective is to maximize the bankâ€™s revenue by minimizing unnecessary retention programs and marketing/acquisition costs for new customers by improving the churn model prediction.

**Key Features:**
- **Data Collection and Cleaning:** Historical customer data is collected, cleaned, and prepared for model training.
- **Feature Engineering:** Develop features indicative of churn, such as account activity patterns.
- **Churn Prediction:** Use XGBoost to predict whether a customer will churn.
- **Model Deployment:** Deploy the trained model using AWS SageMaker for real-time predictions.
- **Monitoring and Refinement:** Continuously monitor model performance and update as needed.

## How to Use
1. **AWS Notebook:** Run the code in the provided Jupyter Notebook on AWS.
2. **Data Connection:** The notebook connects to AWS S3 buckets where the data is stored.
3. **Data Exploration:** Explore and visualize customer data.
4. **Model Training:** Train the churn prediction model using the provided data.
5. **Prediction:** Use the trained model to predict customer churn.

**Results and Evaluation:**
